            <h3>
                Welcome to an organization that is here to fight domestic violence with you!
            </h3>

            <p>
                According to Brian (2023), “According to research, South Africa is considered a country 
                with high cases of domestic violence. Statistics reported for 2023 suggest that over 
                15 000 women were victims of physical and sexual assault. Additionally, more than 960 
                women were killed because of domestic violence related cases.” 
                The whole purpose of this website is to make sure that the cries of domestic violence 
                victims are heard. Many are fatherless because of this abominable and hideous act, 
                and many are also motherless. Many of them are lying in their graves. To think that the 
                last minutes of their lives were nothing but pain and sorrow all because they trusted 
                someone and loved them so much, with no thought of being killed by them dawning on 
                them.
                As an organization, we refuse to tolerate such a heinous act in the community, let alone 
                the entire country. With this website, we will be able to reach out to people suffering 
                from any domestic violence with just a press of a button. You can also book a counselling session with social workers who 
                will be there for you throughout your healing period in your local areas and booking self-defence sessions using the website.
                As said before, our goal is to save lives from domestic violence, and put smiles on the 
                faces of victims.
