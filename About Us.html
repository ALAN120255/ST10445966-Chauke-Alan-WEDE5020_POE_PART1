                Welcome to Our Website / About US
                    Agisanang Domestic Abuse Prevention and Training (ADAPT) is a section 21 No-Profit organization
                    which was founded in 1994. It started as a small entity focusing on providing counselling for abused
                    women but due to demands from the community of Alexandra Township and its partners. It
                    developed beyond counselling to community education, research, advocacy and lobbying as well as
                    building community support for women through training of officials within various disciplines for
                    abused women and vulnerable girl children. The beneficiaries of this service have expanded to
                    include the youth, men and the elderly.
                    The organization is committed to changing social values and structural factors that perpetuate
                    violence against women by promoting a spirit of interdepence, mutual respect and co-existence
                    between men and women. ADAPT also assists people to deal effectively and efficiently with conflict
                    by giving them the opportunity to explore their human relations and awareness skills. These bring
                    about the possibility of better communication and co-operation between those in conflict.
